            The delivery of the service is measured by the number of outcomes it produces.

            Depending on the service, some transactions may take time to reach an outcome and therefore won’t be directly related to those received in the same period.

          <p>  
            For example, if a service is seasonal and a transaction takes several months to reach an outcome it could show a many transactions received with no outcomes in the first month and more outcomes than received in later months.
