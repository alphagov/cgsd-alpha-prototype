          <p>Cross-Government Service Data is designed for civil servants who work across or want to learn from multiple organisations within government.</p>

          <p>It provides standardised high-level metrics along with additional context to help them get a rounded view of each service, agency and department.</p> 

          <p>This data can be explored through the Cross-Government Service Data website or exported as a CSV.</p>
          
          <p>All metrics also come with guidance on how they were collected and calculated to allow easy evaluation of the data.</p>
